Parameters to Experiment With:

1. Multiplier (𝑎) 
The choice of 𝑎 directly affects the quality of the randomness. 
Small values of 𝑎 tend to result in more predictable patterns, making predictions easier.
Better values for 𝑎 are usually large prime numbers chosen carefully to maximize the period of the LCG.

2. Increment (𝑐)
The constant 𝑐 adds a shift to the sequence and ensures no zero cycle in the output.
If 𝑐 is 0, the LCG becomes highly predictable and periodic.
Use a large 𝑐 to reduce predictability.

3. Modulus (𝑚)
𝑚 determines the range of values.
Smaller values of 𝑚 lead to more frequent patterns and easier predictions.
Increasing 𝑚 makes the sequence harder to predict, as the state space becomes larger.

4. Seed (𝑋0)
The starting value 𝑋0 initializes the generator and affects the sequence.
Using the same seed every time makes sequences predictable, while randomizing 𝑋0 increases unpredictability.

5. Number of Tokens Used for Prediction
Use different numbers of prior tokens (𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3,…) for prediction. 
For instance:
Using 2 tokens may lead to less accurate predictions.
Using 3 or more tokens improves accuracy since LCG parameters can be better inferred.
