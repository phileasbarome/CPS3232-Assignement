secrets.token_hex(16) generates a 16-byte cryptographically secure random token in hexadecimal form.
The output is non-deterministic and cannot be predicted using previously generated tokens.

Why the secrets module prevents predictions:

Unlike an LCG, the secrets module uses a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).
CSPRNGs generate unpredictable sequences because they draw entropy from sources that attackers cannot predict.
Compare Predictability:

Attempt to use your prediction algorithm from part (b) on the secrets output.
the prediction algorithm fails because the numbers generated by secrets are non-deterministic.

Printing secure tokens shows that they cannot be reverse-engineered or predicted, even with access to prior tokens.

CSPRNG Strength:

Unlike the LCG, the secure tokens generated by secrets are not based on deterministic mathematical formulas.
There is no correlation between consecutive tokens.

Attack Resistance:

The prediction attack algorithm fails entirely because it relies on knowing deterministic relationships, which do not exist in a CSPRNG.
