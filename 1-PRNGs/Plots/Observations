1. Histogram Analysis
A histogram shows the frequency of generated numbers across their range.

Ideal Behavior:

The distribution should appear uniform, with all bins having roughly equal counts, indicating the generator produces numbers evenly distributed across the range.
What to Observe:

Uniformity: Check whether all ranges of numbers are equally represented.
Clustering: Look for patterns where certain ranges have disproportionately high or low frequencies.
Periodicity: Some LCG parameters may lead to repeating patterns in specific ranges, causing spikes in certain bins.


2. Scatter Plot Analysis
A scatter plot reveals sequential relationships between numbers (e.g., (𝑋𝑖,𝑋𝑖+1)(Xi,Xi+1)).

Ideal Behavior:

The points should appear scattered randomly without forming lines, clusters, or distinct shapes.
This randomness suggests that the generator doesn't have obvious correlations between consecutive numbers.

What to Observe:

Correlations: Check for visible patterns, such as lines or grids, indicating dependency between consecutive values.
Periodic Patterns: LCGs are known to have cycles. If the modulus 𝑚 is small or poorly chosen, points may form repetitive patterns.
Density: Check if points are more concentrated in certain areas, indicating biased or non-random behavior.

3. Documenting Observations

After generating 10,000 random numbers using the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and visualizing the results with a histogram and scatter plot, the following patterns were observed:

Scatter Plot:

Short Range: When the range of values ([𝑙𝑜𝑤,ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ][low,high]) is small, the scatter plot exhibits distinct lines. This is because the reduced range confines the output to a limited subset of values, amplifying the visible correlation between consecutive numbers.

Small Modulus (𝑚): When the modulus 𝑚 is small, the scatter plot similarly displays linear patterns or grids. This occurs due to the periodicity and limited number of possible values that the generator can produce, leading to predictable sequences.

Histogram:

Peaks at Range Edges: The histogram shows pronounced peaks near the boundaries of the range. This suggests that certain values or regions within the range are more likely to occur, indicating a bias in the distribution of generated numbers. This effect is amplified by the choice of LCG parameters (𝑎,𝑐,𝑚,a,c,m) and their interaction with the range.
